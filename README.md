# HoRNS - Hawking Radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars: applications to pion and axion production
## Authors: Hao-Ran Cui, Yuhsin Tsai, Tao Xu

The code file "HoRNS.nb" is written by Mathematica 13.1 and associated with arxiv: 2407.01675. It provides the numerical simulation of the following functions for Hawking radiation of massive scalars from a primordial black hole: 

1. The production rate of a massive scalar (based on Eq. (2.1) of the paper):

$$\large{\frac{dN}{dtd\omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\Gamma_{\omega}}{e^{\omega/T_H}-1}}$$ 

where $\omega$ is the scalar's energy, $\Gamma_{\omega}$ is the greybody factor, and $T_{H}$ is the black hole temperature. 

2. The emission (absorption) cross-section of a massive scalar (based on Eq. (2.10) of the paper):

$$\large{\sigma=\frac{\pi}{\omega^2-m^2}\sum_{l=1}^{\infty}(2l+1)|T_{\omega l}|^2=\frac{\pi}{\omega^2-m^2}\Gamma_{\omega}}$$

where $m$ is the scalar's mass, $l$ is angular momentum quantum number, $|T_{\omega l}|$ is transition rate for the scalar of energy $\omega$ and angular momentum $l$ to reach infinity.
